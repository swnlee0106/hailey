							<h1 class="major">France's Controversial Tax Imposition</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/flag.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>France has decided to impose tax on the so-called American “tech giants.” A three percent tax will be levied on the sales produced by firms such as Google and Facebook. France has announced that relevant companies that have revenues amassing to more than 750 million euros are subjected to the new tax policy. Due to this imposition of tax, there has been heated debates as to whether the tax was necessary.
</p>
							<p>However, why impose tax on the tech giants? France believes that even though the tech companies do not have physical presence, digital presence should also be accounted for when imposing tax. For the European Union (EU) to follow the lead, there needs to be a consensus among the member nations; nonetheless, countries such as Ireland, Sweden, Finland, and Czech Republic opposed to the levy.
</p>
							<p>The Trump administration is not amused with the move. Robert Lighthizer, a trade representative in the United States (US), stated that investigations will tell “whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts US commerce."
</p>
							<p>The main argument of the US is that if France takes the money from the American tech giants, the US can also do the same to French companies in the US; there is a potential of an outbreak of a trade war taking place. The US can impose tariffs on nations like France that are “taking the US for a ride.” France, however, is promulgating that they want a multilateral agreement on how to globally tax digital firms. Another preferable outcome for France would be other countries following the trajectory that France is taking, and implementing its laws as the nation believes that it is just to do so.
